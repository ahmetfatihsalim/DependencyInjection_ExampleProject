# DependencyInjection_ExampleProject
Simple examples that show different types of lifetimes

This is a basic example project to help understand the differences between different lifetime types. 
In this project, we show two Guids for each lifetime. 
These lifetimes are Singleton, Scoped, and Transient lifetimes

By reloading and restarting the project, we can observe different behaviors of the prementioned lifetimes
