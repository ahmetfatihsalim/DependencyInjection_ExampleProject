# DependencyInjection_ExampleProject
Simple examples that show different types of lifetimes

This is a basic example project to help understand the differences between different lifetime types. 
In this project, we show two Guids for each lifetime. 
These lifetimes are Singleton, Scoped, and Transient lifetime

By reloading and restating the project, we can observe different behaviors of the lifetimes above
